# 🏃‍♂️ marathon-performance-predictor
## A Data Analytics and Machine Learning Project on Ultra Marathon Races Between 2021 and 2023 

#### This project aims to predict athlete performance in various sports events based on event details, athlete demographics, and other relevant factors. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can analyze historical data and make accurate predictions for new inputs.

### 🔍 Overview
- Preprocessing data set of athlete performance alongside athlete metadata and event details
- Applying target encoding to categorize event names (Mean of atheltes performances in a specific event)
- Applyed label encoding for binary variables (Athlete Gender)
- Utilized a random forest regressor to perform predictions based on given inputs
- Created a simple data pipeline to handle user inputs into formattable model preset and make predictions

### 🔄 Project Workflow
#### 📋 Dataset Preparation:
- The dataset contains columns like athlete age, gender, event name, event distance, and the target variable: athlete performance.
- Categorical variables are encoded using appropriate methods (e.g., target and label encoding).

### 🧹Data Preprocessing:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Apply target encoding for high-cardinality features like event names.
- Apply label encoding for binary features like gender.

### 🤖 Model Training:
- Train a Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.

### 🔮 User Prediction:
- Create a pipeline to preprocess user input and predict athlete performance for new scenarios.
